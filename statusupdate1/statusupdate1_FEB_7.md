## What I Have Done
> I have cloned our project repo and installed the requested enviroments
> I am assigned to deal with RLcard, an open source card game artificial intelligence environment. The ultimate goal is to use it to write AI for our web app to play uno game.
> I have learned Rlcard functions and used it to create two game environments for UNO, and tested random agent on the environments. The example codes are in this folder [https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate1](https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate1), to run them you need to first install RLcard by '''pip install rlcard'''.

## What's next
> I will implement a wrapper class  for the uno environment to make it easier to use.( Since the UNO module for RLcard is poor developed. For instance, it even doesn't have the function to change the player number. I had to read two env source code files to find out what Classes's public values should be changed directly)

## Anything blocking
> If you can finish my other courses' homework for me, that will be a great help! 36 hours homeworks every week, damn!
> It seems I will have to use tensorflow to deal with the AI part, and that seems challenging.
