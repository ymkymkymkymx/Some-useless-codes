## What I Have Done
* I have created the a python class RlUno which packs up the fuctions of original RlCard uno game and added some new functions like changing the game size to it. The python class in this folder [https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate2](https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate2), to run them you need to first install RLcard by '''pip install rlcard'''.

## What's next
* I will add functions to the class. One of the functions that is needed the most now is a game mode that allows human to play with serveral AI. Currently we only have mode for AI against AI for the training purposes but it should be easy to convert that mode to human against AI mode.


## Anything blocking
* If you can finish my other courses' homework for me, that will be a great help!
