## What I Have Done
* I have implemented the deep q learning agent training part for UNO game and modified my uno code to pass status to train the agent. The python code and results in this folder [https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate5](https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate5), to run it you need to first install RLcard by '''pip install rlcard'''.
* I have tried to train the agent with different mlp layers combinations but none of them works well after 10000 times of games.
## What's next
* I will try more mlp layers settings to let the agent works and got through my codes to see if there are some bugs.


## Anything blocking
* If you can finish my other courses' homework for me, that will be a great help! 
* I don't know how many layers and nodes are approximately needed for the game with 420 inputs and 60 outputs.
