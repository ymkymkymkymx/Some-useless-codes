## What I Have Done
* I have implemented the save model option and saved some models. I also wrote a model vs model program to see which mode is better.  [https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate7](https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate7), to run it you need to first install RLcard by '''pip install rlcard'''. Also, it is important to keep the structure of experiment file because I store the trained model there and hard coded the directory in program to use them.
* I have also packed up a dqn model in a DqnModel class. I have put it in unogame.py's examples and tried to play against it for 3 games, I lost all. I don't think my model is good because I suck at this game and UNO is just a game of pure luck. 'Yes! I am talking to you AI!!! I am bad doesn't mean you are good. You are still traaaash! You can't win me without luck!!!!'
## What's next
* I have shared my code with the front end team and will be focus on helping them to put the game into website in the future weeks.

## Anything blocking
* If you can finish my other courses' homework for me, that will be a great help!
