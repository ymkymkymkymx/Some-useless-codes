## What I Have Done
* I have focused on the group presentation last week.[https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate8](https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate8)
* I have also played around my codes to get statistics for the presentation. 
## What's next
* I have shared my code with the front end team and will be focus on helping them to put the game into website in the future weeks.
* Do some bug fixing and try to see if other algorithms are better.

## Anything blocking
* If you can finish my other courses' homework for me, that will be a great help!
