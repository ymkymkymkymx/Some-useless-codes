## What I Have Done
* I have documented my codes so that future developers will understand my code more easily.  [https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate9](https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate9), to run it you need to first install RLcard by '''pip install rlcard'''. Also, it is important to keep the structure of experiment file because I store the trained model there and hard coded the directory in program to use them.
* I have learned something about the server and front end but not enough. I probably won't have enough time to put the game into the webapp.
## What's next
* I will check the front end team's progress and see if I can help them. I will also start to document my codes and try if I can put them into server on my own.

## Anything blocking
* If you can finish my other courses' homework for me, that will be a great help!
