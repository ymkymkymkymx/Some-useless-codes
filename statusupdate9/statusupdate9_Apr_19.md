## What I Have Done
* I have implemented the continuous trainning function which can read in previously saved models and then continue to train them.  [https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate9](https://github.com/ymkymkymkymx/Some-useless-codes/tree/master/statusupdate9), to run it you need to first install RLcard by '''pip install rlcard'''. Also, it is important to keep the structure of experiment file because I store the trained model there and hard coded the directory in program to use them.
* I have trained the previous models and let them played against each others.
* I communicated with the front end team and it seems that they don't have time to put my code into server this semester so I will probably have to start to document my code for future developers.
## What's next
* I will check the front end team's progress and see if I can help them. I will also start to document my codes and try if I can put them into server on my own.

## Anything blocking
* If you can finish my other courses' homework for me, that will be a great help!
